    <h1>History</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>In 2013, the two founders, Sriharsha Majety and Nandan Reddy, designed an e-commerce website called Bundl to facilitate courier</p>
    <p>service and shipping within India.[6] Bundl was halted, and was rebranded to enter the food delivery market.[7] At the time, the food</p>
    <p>delivery sector was in turmoil as several notable startups, such as Foodpanda (later acquired by Ola Cabs), TinyOwl (later acquired by</p>
    <p>Zomato) and Ola Cafe (later closed) were struggling.[6][7] Majety and Reddy approached Rahul Jaimini, formerly with Myntra, and</p>
    <p>founded food court and parent holding company Bundl Technologies in 2013.[7] The company built a dedicated delivery network and grew</p>
    <p>rapidly, primarily driven by the focus on logistics and locking in key resources.[7]</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>In early 2019, food court  expanded into general product deliveries under the name food court Stores, sourcing items from local stores.</p>
    <p>In August 2020, the company launched its instant grocery delivery service called Instamart using a network of dark stores.[11][12] In early</p>
    <p>2021, food court closed food court Stores and expanded its operations under Instamart</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>In September 2019,food court launched instant pickup/dropoff servicefood court Go.[14] The service is used for a diverse array of items,</p>
    <p>including laundry and document or parcel deliveries to business clients and retail customers.[15] In April 2020, it rebranded food courtGo</p>
    <p>as food court Genie</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>In May 2020, food court laid off 1100 employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>In 2021, the company announced that it would cover the vaccination cost for its delivery partners.</p>
